## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Puter API Usage Concerns

1. While Puter advertises access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet, there are some inconsistencies in model behavior that suggest it might be running an older version or potentially Claude 2.
2. The model's responses indicate a knowledge cutoff date of October 2023, which is earlier than the official latest Claude 3.5 Sonnet release.
3. There is currently no clear documentation about rate limits or fair usage policies from Puter.
4. This implementation relies on Puter's continued free API access, which may change in the future.
